# AnimeRSSMove
Made to move input anime episodes from torrent client downloading from RSS feed to an automatically created subdirectory with proper anime name.

I use this with Tixati with the file completion shell command:

```
file:powershell "C:\Scripts\AnimeRSSMove.ps1 -OutputPath X:\ -InputFile \"$basepath$name$ext\""
```
